
Mongo DB Implementation and XML Formation

Name: AMEY JAYANT PURANIK


In this project, we have implemented data population from the flat relational format to mongo DB complex object format. We have implemented this algorithm in Java SE 8 as base programming language and Eclipse neon 2 as integrated development environment.
The project is attached in the zip file with the name Mongo db. We have submitted the pseudo code for this project and referring that code we have implemented the project.
The formation of this flat xml format is also done in the XML format. Which is done using java code. The project is attached in XMLformation .zip. The output for both project and department table s attached in the zip folder.

Guidelines to execute the project.
•	To run this project successfully we need to have eclipse neon 2 version installed in the system.
•	Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
•	Version: Neon.2 Release (4.6.2)
•	Then, we need to import the zip file with the name mongo_xml.zip in the eclipse IDE.
•	Click on file on the top right corner of the IDE.
•	Select Import.
•	And import the mongo.zip and XMLformation.zip in the IDE.
•	Before compiling and running the project, we need to follow the below note.
Important Note: - 
******************************************************************************
(Before compiling these project, we need to create the folder with the name root in the E:\ directory of the system. And we need to store the input files in this folder. I have attached the root folder in the zip file. We can just copy this root folder in the E:\root directory of the system. 
The input should be saved in the text file in the above given path. We have attached the root folder with all the input records in separate text file. Root folder is attached with the zip file. 
(Path is being hardcoded in the code)

•	After the root folder is created we need to click on the run command in the IDE.

•	This will populate all the documents into the collections.

•	The Mongo DB and Join queries are attached in the zip file.
